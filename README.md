‚ö°Ô∏è*Highly efficient data and string formatting library for Rust.*

</div>

## üîé Overview

Pad and format string slices and generic vectors efficiently with minimal memory allocation.
This crate has guaranteed performance improvements over the standard library `format!` macro.
Clone this repo and run `cargo bench` to see benchmark comparisons between our implementation and the standard library.

The library defines a core trait called `Source` and also has this implemented on two main
types of datastructures, the string slice `&str` and a generic vector `Vec<T>` with some trait bounds on the type `T`. 
This allows for any developer to implement the trait on any datastructure that they want to be
able to pad or format using any of the padding modes defined in the crate.

## üì¶ Installation

The easiest way to include *padder* in your projects is by using the [Cargo](https://crates.io/) package manager.
```
$ cargo add padder
```

Alternatively, you can build from source by cloning this repo and compiling using Cargo and then linking the library to your project.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/firelink-data/padder.git
$ cd padder
$ cargo build --release
```

## üöÄ Examples

Adding *padder* to your crate dependecy will bring the `Source` trait into scope and allow padding. 

You can for example pad string slices very easily in the following way:

```rust
let padded: String = "cool".pad(10, Alignment::Center, Symbol::Zero);
```

which would produce the padded String `000cool000`. You can also pad to an already allocated buffer, allowing you full control of heap allocations, like below:

```rust
let width: usize = 8;
let mut output: Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(width);
let original = vec![13u8, 9, 128, 81];
original.pad_and_push_to_buffer(width, Alignment::Right, Symbol::Whitespace, output);
```

There also exists two wrapper methods simply called `pad` and `pad_and_push_to_buffer` which allows padding any object as long as it implements the `Source` trait.
You can for example use these functions like below:
```rust
// pad
let original: &str = "hej";
let width: usize = 9;
let output: String = pad(original, width, Alignment::Left, Symbol::Hyphen);

// pad_and_push_to_buffer
let buffer = String::with_capacity(11);
pad_and_push_to_buffer("testcool", 11, Alignment::Right, Symbol::Whitespace);
```

which would produce the strings `hej------` and `   testcool`.
